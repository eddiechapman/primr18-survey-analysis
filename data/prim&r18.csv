Our legal department wouldn't be too happy about that and doing so would violate a host of institutional policies.  So we are back to the public data issue again. Of course there are ethical issues. And none of this is new. The Internet, cheap storage and computing power just makes it all so much easier. But it's just a playing out of practices that are hundreds of years old. Foucault was lecturing on this decades ago. See Security, Territory, Population, particularly chapter 3. For a more recent take see Bernard Harcourt.   All human knowledge has ethical concerns because none of it is separate from the exercise of power.

That had potentially very harmful impact on people who are not 'out', at a very minimum it's an invasion of privacy by taking away their control over information about themselves.

So then the issue as to whether it involves human subjects comes down to whether it involves private identifiable information. The information is private. Is it identifiable? Practically all data has the potential for being re-identified so there has to be some judgment or standard. And that judgment would be stricter if the risk was higher. Presumably there would also be some sort of data sharing agreement involved to protect the data from use for purposes other than the stated research purposes.
